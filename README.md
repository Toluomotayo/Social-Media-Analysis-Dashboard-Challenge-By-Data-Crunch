# Social Media Challenge Dashboard - Data Crunch Dataset Challenge
## Introduction
Welcome to my latest project for the Data Crunch Dataset Challenge, hosted in collaboration with Power BI: Peer Review Hub! This interactive, two-page Power BI dashboard combines insights and creativity to explore user behavior, engagement, and digital well-being. I used PowerPoint, Figma, and Power BI for data visualization and storytelling.
